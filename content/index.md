## Overview

**_Kath_ is a user-friendly GUI tool designed to streamline the in-depth analysis of gene variation data from LOVD, gnomAD, and ClinVar genetic databases**. By consolidating critical information into an accessible interface, _Kath_ empowers researchers, clinicians, and geneticists to uncover actionable insights with ease.

Built for efficiency and adaptability, it is ideal for tasks such as assessing pathogenicity or cross-referencing genetic variant data. It serves as a vital tool for advancing research, improving diagnostics, and supporting genomic studies.
