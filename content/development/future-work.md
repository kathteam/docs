## Sneak Peek

_Kath_ will undergo a comprehensive **UI redesign** aimed at enhancing the user experience by making the interface even more intuitive and visually engaging. This redesign will streamline navigation and improve access to its advanced tools, allowing researchers to analyze gene variation data from LOVD, GNOMAD, and CLINVAR databases with greater ease.

> [!warning] Challenge 
> The current UI has limitations in navigation and ease of access to advanced tools, making it more time-consuming for researchers to analyze gene variation data from databases. Additionally, there is a learning curve in effectively utilizing the available tools. The redesign aims to address these issues and provide a more seamless and intuitive experience.

## Reshaping Architecture

The _Kath_ **architecture is set to undergo a complete redesign** to address existing limitations in the current implementation. As it stands, the architecture is unoptimized and lacks proper organization, which impacts performance and maintainability. This step would include rebuilding the architecture with a clean, modular, and maintainable design and introduction of a proper database to efficiently store and manage application data. This will serve as a solid foundation for long-term growth, ensuring a more reliable and efficient experience for researchers.

> [!warning] Challenge 
> The existing _Kath_ architecture is unoptimized and lacks proper organization, which affects performance, scalability, and maintainability. Additionally, the lack of a structured database makes data management inefficient. The redesign will address these limitations by introducing a clean, modular design and implementing a robust database to better handle application data, providing a more reliable and scalable foundation for long-term growth.
